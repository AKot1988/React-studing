1) On my opinion for instaling CRA i was spend twice more time than to create VITE React template
2) vite gives me opportunity to create template with TS. CRA dosent ask me any question and dosent give me some option. I have to instal TS manually, and (possibly) i have to rename files resolution.
P.S. Later i have found "npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript"
3) VITE dosent likes long absolute path to project dir, in case CRA i dosen faced with this case
4) VITE works more quikly then cra, in case VITE i shouldn`t refresh browser if some changes have apply to some jsx\tsx files
5) VITE template has less weight (near 4 times) than CRA
6) About config of both templates I don't have any conclusions yet. But, it seems to me that the template created using CRA can be properly configured and it will also reload the page in the browser and provide some additional features.
